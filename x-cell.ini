[additional]
; BSScaleformSysMemMapper was separated from the main x-cell memory manager. This option indicates the page size in KB, 
; which is allocated at once, if necessary, to allocate a new page, the vanilla size is 64 KB. 
; One call takes more than 1K processor cycles and turns to 0 ring, thereby stopping all threads, causing a freeze.
; The larger this number, the fewer calls, however, memory consumption will increase.
; Limit 2Mb (2048) installed programmatically, number must be a multiple of 8.
scaleform_page_size=256
; BSScaleformSysMemMapper was separated from the main x-cell memory manager. This option indicates the heap size in MB,
; which is reserved at once. This is all the available memory, if the memory runs out you will get a CTD. The vanilla size is 128 MB.
; Memory is reserved, not allocated, thus there is no initial increase in memory consumption.
; Limit 2Gb (2048) installed programmatically, number must be a multiple of 8. If you don't have even that much memory, 
; it's worth thinking about your MCM menu.
scaleform_heap_size=512
; Create file "<FALLOUT4_DIR>\\Data\\F4SE\\Plugins\\rtti-x-cell.txt" with rtti info
rtti_output=false

; Optionally exclude some NPCs. Specify the parent FormID.
; The larger this list, the worse the optimization. 
; Example: <UniqueName>=<FormID>.
; If you need to exclude something having a floating loading order.
; FormID is taken by mask, depending on the type of plugin (0x00FFFFFF - for master or plugin, 0x00000FFF - for light master).
; PluginName is the one that first added this NPC. Do not specify any replicer mods.
; Example: <UniqueName>=<FormID>:<PluginName>.
