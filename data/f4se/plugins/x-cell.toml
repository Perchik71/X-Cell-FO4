# X-CELL FALLOUT 4 PLUGIN SETTINGS

[Patches]
bThreads=true					# All threads have priority above idle, process above normal, for adequate latency, prohibition on changing processor cores.
bMemory=true					# Replaced memory manager and scrap heap, also functions for working with memory.
bFacegen=true					# Enables facegen support and removes freezes.
bIO=true						# Replacing file search functions with a newer one and use OS file cache for less disk access (Actual only HDD).
bLibDeflate=true				# Replace old zlib decompression code with optimized libdeflate https://github.com/ebiggers/libdeflate.
bProfile=true					# Replacing outdated functions WritePrivateProfileStringA, GetPrivateProfileStringA, GetPrivateProfileIntA. They read INI files. 
bLoadScreen=false				# Black loading screen.
bUpscaler=false					# Increase FPS due to scaling, requires Win 8.1 and newer, and a graphics card with hardware scaling support.

[NGFixes]						# Only NG version game. Already present in Buffout 4, but are missing in Buffout 4 NG (at time 28.09.2024).
bGreyMovies=true				# Fixes a bug where movies that don't define "BackgroundAlpha" on their movie root could load with a grey background.
bPackageAllocateLocation=true	# Fixes a crash when allocating the location for a package.
bWarningCreateTexture2D=false	# Warns when a call to CreateTexture2D fails.

[Additional]
uScaleformPageSize=256			# The page size (in KB), vanilla size is 64. More, better, but the higher the memory consumption. Limit 2Mb (2048), number must be a multiple of 8 (Need bMemory patch).
uScaleformHeapSize=512			# The heap size (in MB), vanilla size is 128. This is all the available memory, out of memory = CTD. Limit 2Gb (2048), number must be a multiple of 8 (Need bMemory patch).
bUseNewRedistributable=false	# Replaces the old redistributable with a new one. If option is enabled, reports will include X-Cell in case of errors related to copying or comparing memory (Need bMemory patch).
bOutputRTTI=false				# Create file "<FALLOUT4_DIR>\\Data\\F4SE\\Plugins\\rtti-x-cell.txt" with rtti info.
bUseIORandomAccess=true 		# Activate a prompt for the system that you need to use a cache with random access, otherwise it will be sequential (Need bIO patch). 

[PostProccessing]				# Need Upscaler patch
bUsePostProcessing=false		# Enabling X-Cell post-processing.
fDisplayScale=0.75				# Scaling in for the game screen. Range: [0.5, 1]
bNoUseTAA=false					# Do not use the original TAA, which causes slight ripples.
fEdgeThreshold=0.1				# Specifies the threshold or sensitivity to edges. Lowering this value you will be able to detect more edges at the expense of performance. Range: [0, 0.5].
fEdgeLocalContrastFactor=0.5	# Specifies the threshold in local contrast adaptation. Range: [0, 1]
fCornerAreaFactor=0.5			# Specifies how much sharp corners will be rounded. Range: [0, 1]
uMaxSearchDistanceLen=8			# Max number of iterations in searching edge pattern. Range: [0, 128]
